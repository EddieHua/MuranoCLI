Do more from the command line with [Murano](https://exosite.com/platform/)

MrMurano is the command-line tool that interacts with Murano and makes different
tasks easier. MrMurano makes it easy to deploy code to a solution, import many
product definitions at once, set up endpoints and APIs, and more.

MrMurano works around the idea of syncing, much like rsync.  Files from your project
directory are synced up (or down) from Murano.

!!!!! *IMPORTANT*

The upcoming release of 2.0 will include some breaking changes.  The most noticable
of which is the command will be renamed from `mr` to `murano`.


## Usage

### To start from an existing project in Murano
```
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
murano config solution.id XXXXXX
murano syncdown -V
```

Do stuff, see what changed: `murano status` or `murano diff`.
Then deploy with `murano syncup`

### To start a brand new project
There are a few steps and pieces to getting a solution with a product up and
running in Murano. Here is the list.

- Pick a business: `murano account --business`
	If this is the first time you've run `murano` it will ask for your Murano username
	and password.
- Set it: `murano config business.id ZZZZZZZZZ`
- Create a product: `murano product create myawesomeproduct`
- Save the result: `murano config product.id YYYYYYYYY`
- Add resource aliases to specs/resources.yaml
- Sync the product definition up: `murano syncup -V --specs`
- Create a solution: `murano solution create myawesomesolution`
- Save the result: `murano config solution.id XXXXXX`
- Sync solution code up: `murano syncup -V`
- Assign the product to the solution: `murano assign set`

Do stuff, see what changed: `murano status` or `murano diff`.
Then deploy with `murano syncup`

## Install

When upgrading from a 1.\* version to a 2.0, you should uninstall the old versions
first.
```
> gem uninstall MrMurano`
```

And then install:

```
> gem install MrMurano
```
Or
```
> gem update MrMurano
```

You will likely need to be root for the above commands.  If you would rather not
install as root, you can install gems in the user directory.

```
> gem install MrMurano --user-install
```

Your `PATH` may need to be updated to find the installed `murano` command.  See the
[Ruby Gem FAQ](http://guides.rubygems.org/faqs/#user-install).  In short, you need
to add the output of `ruby -rubygems -e 'puts Gem.user_dir'` to your `PATH`.

### Windows Install

The MrMurano gem will install on Windows.  There is also a single Windows binary
Setup installer availible in [releases](https://github.com/exosite/MrMurano/releases)

If you do not already use Ruby on Windows, then you should use the binary
installer.

When upgrading, it is best to run the uninstaller for the old version before
installing the new version.


## Features

### Logs

You can monitor the log messages from your solution with the `murano logs --follow`.
Or quickly get the last few with `murano logs`

MrMurano does a few things to make your log output easier to follow.
- Adds color to easily see where each log message starts.
- Reformats the timestamps to be in local time.
- Finds JSON blobs and pretty prints them.

All of these can be toggled with command line options.

### MURANO_CONFIGFILE environment and Dotenv

The environment variable `MURANO_CONFIGFILE` is checked for an additional config to
load.  This in conjuction with dotenv support, allows for easily switching between
development, staging, and production setups.

To use this, write the three solution ids into `.murano.dev`, `.murano.stg`,
and `.murano.prod`. Then write the `.env` file to point at the system you're
currently working on.

The files for this are then:
```
cat >> .murano.dev <<EOF
[solution]
id=AAAAAAAA
EOF

cat >> .murano.stg <<EOF
[solution]
id=BBBBBBBB
EOF

cat >> .murano.prod <<EOF
[solution]
id=CCCCCCCC
EOF

cat > .env <<EOF
MURANO_CONFIGFILE=.murano.dev
EOF
```

This also allows for keeping private things in a seperate config file and having
the shared things checked into source control.

### Direct Service Access

To aid with debugging, MrMurano has direct access to some of the services in a
solution.

Currently these are:
- Keystore: `murano keystore`
- Timeseries: `murano timeseries`
- TSDB: `murano tsdb`

### Output Format

Many sub-commands respect the `outformat` setting.  This lets you switch the output
between YAML, JSON, Ruby, CSV, and pretty tables.  Not all formats work with all
commands.

```
> murano tsdb product list
> murano tsdb product list -c outformat=csv
> murano tsdb product list -c outformat=json
> murano tsdb product list -c outformat=yaml
> murano tsdb product list -c outformat=pp
```

### Product Content Area

MrMurano can manage the content area for a product.  This area is a place to store
files for use by devices.  Typically holding firmware images for Over-The-Air
updating.  Although any kind of fleet wide data that devices may need to download
can be stored here.

Once the `product.id` is set, the content for that product can be accessed with the
following commands:
```
> murano content list
> murano content upload
> murano content info
> murano content delete
> murano content download
```

Call them with `--help` for details.

## Developing

MrMurano uses [git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow#getting-started) for
[managing branches](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

MrMurano also uses [bundler](http://bundler.io).
